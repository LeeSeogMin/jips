## 9. Conclusion

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that both statistical and deep learning approaches to topic model evaluation have distinct strengths and limitations. The strong positive correlation (r = 0.846) between methods validates the fundamental constructs being measured, while the superior discrimination capability of deep learning methods suggests their value for nuanced quality assessment.

The absence of systematic bias between methods (p = 0.536) indicates that both approaches are valid, with deep learning methods offering enhanced precision and novel evaluation dimensions. The perfect reproducibility of DL methods vs acceptable variability in statistical methods highlights the trade-off between computational determinism and traditional statistical robustness.

**Key Recommendation**: Adopt a hybrid evaluation framework that leverages the precision of deep learning methods while maintaining the interpretability and established validity of statistical approaches.
