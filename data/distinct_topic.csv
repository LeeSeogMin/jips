morphological biochemical trait tend similar among specie share recent common ancestor historically used reconstruct phylogenetic tree although direct comparison genetic sequence common method today evolutionary biologist continued study various aspect evolution forming testing hypothesis well constructing theory based evidence field laboratory data generated method mathematical theoretical biology,evolution_theory
discovery influenced development biology also field including agriculture medicine computer science heredity evolution organism occurs change heritable characteristicsthe inherited characteristic organism,evolution_theory
human example eye colour inherited characteristic individual might inherit browneye trait one parent,evolution_theory
inherited trait controlled gene complete set gene within organism genome genetic material called genotype complete set observable trait make structure behaviour organism called phenotype,evolution_theory
trait come interaction genotype environment others neutral,evolution_theory
example suntanned skin come interaction person genotype sunlight thus suntan passed people child,evolution_theory
phenotype ability skin tan exposed sunlight,evolution_theory
however people tan easily others due difference genotypic variation striking example people inherited trait albinism tan sensitive sunburn heritable characteristic passed one generation next via dna molecule encodes genetic information,evolution_theory
dna long biopolymer composed four type base,evolution_theory
sequence base along particular dna molecule specifies genetic information manner similar sequence letter spelling sentence,evolution_theory
cell divide dna copied resulting two cell inherit dna sequence,evolution_theory
portion dna molecule specify single functional unit called gene different gene different sequence base,evolution_theory
within cell long strand dna called chromosome,evolution_theory
specific location dna sequence within chromosome known locus,evolution_theory
dna sequence locus varies individual different form sequence called allele,evolution_theory
mutation occurs within gene new allele may affect trait gene control altering phenotype organism,evolution_theory
however simple correspondence allele trait work case trait influenced multiple gene quantitative epistatic manner source variation evolution occur genetic variation within population,evolution_theory
variation come mutation genome reshuffling gene sexual reproduction migration population gene flow,evolution_theory
despite constant introduction new variation mutation gene flow genome specie similar among individual specie,evolution_theory
however discovery field evolutionary developmental biology demonstrated even relatively small difference genotype lead dramatic difference phenotype within specie individual organism phenotype result genotype influence environment lived,evolution_theory
modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution change time genetic variation,evolution_theory
frequency one particular allele become less prevalent relative form gene,evolution_theory
variation disappears new allele reach point fixationwhen either disappears population replaces ancestral allele entirely mutation mutation change dna sequence cell genome ultimate source genetic variation organism,evolution_theory
mutation occur may alter product gene prevent gene functioning effect,evolution_theory
half mutation coding region proteincoding gene deleterious half neutral,evolution_theory
small percentage total mutation region confer fitness benefit,evolution_theory
mutation part genome deleterious vast majority neutral,evolution_theory
beneficial mutation involve large section chromosome becoming duplicated usually genetic recombination introduce extra copy gene genome,evolution_theory
extra copy gene major source raw material needed new gene evolve,evolution_theory
important new gene evolve within gene family preexisting gene share common ancestor,evolution_theory
example human eye us four gene make structure sense light three colour vision one night vision four descended single ancestral gene new gene generated ancestral gene duplicate copy mutates acquires new function,evolution_theory
process easier gene duplicated increase redundancy system one gene pair acquire new function copy continues perform original function,evolution_theory
type mutation even generate entirely new gene previously noncoding dna phenomenon termed de novo gene birth generation new gene also involve small part several gene duplicated fragment recombining form new combination new function exon shuffling,evolution_theory
new gene assembled shuffling preexisting part domain act module simple independent function mixed together produce new combination new complex function,evolution_theory
example polyketide synthases large enzyme make antibiotic contain independent domain catalyse one step overall process like step assembly line one example mutation wild boar piglet,evolution_theory
camouflage coloured show characteristic pattern dark light longitudinal stripe,evolution_theory
however mutation melanocortin receptor mcr disrupt pattern,evolution_theory
majority pig breed carry mcr mutation disrupting wildtype colour different mutation causing dominant black colouring sex recombination asexual organism gene inherited together linked mix gene organism reproduction,evolution_theory
contrast offspring sexual organism contain random mixture parent chromosome produced independent assortment,evolution_theory
related process called homologous recombination sexual organism exchange dna two matching chromosome,evolution_theory
recombination reassortment alter allele frequency instead change allele associated producing offspring new combination allele,evolution_theory
sex usually increase genetic variation may increase rate evolution twofold cost sex first described john maynard smith,evolution_theory
first cost sexually dimorphic specie one two sex bear young,evolution_theory
cost apply hermaphroditic specie like plant many invertebrate,evolution_theory
second cost individual reproduces sexually pas gene individual offspring even less passed new generation pass,evolution_theory
yet sexual reproduction common mean reproduction among eukaryote multicellular organism,evolution_theory
red queen hypothesis used explain significance sexual reproduction mean enable continual evolution adaptation response coevolution specie everchanging environment,evolution_theory
another hypothesis sexual reproduction primarily adaptation promoting accurate recombinational repair damage germline dna increased diversity byproduct process may sometimes adaptively beneficial gene flow gene flow exchange gene population specie,evolution_theory
therefore source variation new population specie,evolution_theory
gene flow caused movement individual separate population organism might caused movement mouse inland coastal population movement pollen heavymetaltolerant heavymetalsensitive population grass gene transfer specie includes formation hybrid organism horizontal gene transfer,evolution_theory
horizontal gene transfer transfer genetic material one organism another organism offspring common among bacteria,evolution_theory
medicine contributes spread antibiotic resistance one bacteria acquires resistance gene rapidly transfer specie,evolution_theory
horizontal transfer gene bacteria eukaryote yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae adzuki bean weevil callosobruchus chinensis occurred,evolution_theory
example largerscale transfer eukaryotic bdelloid rotifer received range gene bacteria fungi plant,evolution_theory
virus also carry dna organism allowing transfer gene even across biological domain largescale gene transfer also occurred ancestor eukaryotic cell bacteria acquisition chloroplast mitochondrion,evolution_theory
possible eukaryote originated horizontal gene transfer bacteria archaea epigenetics heritable change explained change sequence nucleotide dna,evolution_theory
dna methylation marking chromatin selfsustaining metabolic loop gene silencing rna interference threedimensional conformation protein prion area epigenetic inheritance system discovered organismic level,evolution_theory
developmental biologist suggest complex interaction genetic network communication among cell lead heritable variation may underlay mechanic developmental plasticity canalisation,evolution_theory
example ecological inheritance process niche construction defined regular repeated activity organism environment,evolution_theory
generates legacy effect modify feed back selection regime subsequent generation,evolution_theory
example heritability evolution direct control gene include inheritance cultural trait symbiogenesis evolutionary force neodarwinian perspective evolution occurs change frequency allele within population interbreeding organism example allele black colour population moth becoming common,evolution_theory
mechanism lead change allele frequency include natural selection genetic drift mutation bias natural selection evolution natural selection process trait enhance survival reproduction become common successive generation population,evolution_theory
embodies three principle variation exists within population organism respect morphology physiology behaviour phenotypic variation different trait confer different rate survival reproduction differential fitness trait passed generation generation heritability fitness offspring produced possibly survive condition produce competition organism survival reproduction,evolution_theory
consequently organism trait give advantage competitor likely pas trait next generation trait confer advantage,evolution_theory
teleonomy quality whereby process natural selection creates preserve trait seemingly fitted functional role perform,evolution_theory
consequence selection include nonrandom mating genetic hitchhiking central concept natural selection evolutionary fitness organism,evolution_theory
fitness measured organism ability survive reproduce determines size genetic contribution next generation,evolution_theory
however fitness total number offspring instead fitness indicated proportion subsequent generation carry organism gene,evolution_theory
example organism could survive well reproduce rapidly offspring small weak survive organism would make little genetic contribution future generation would thus low fitness allele increase fitness allele gene generation allele higher probability becoming common within population,evolution_theory
trait said selected example trait increase fitness enhanced survival increased fecundity,evolution_theory
conversely lower fitness caused less beneficial deleterious allele result allele likely becoming rarerthey selected importantly fitness allele fixed characteristic environment change previously neutral harmful trait may become beneficial previously beneficial trait become harmful,evolution_theory
however even direction selection reverse way trait lost past may reevolve identical form,evolution_theory
however reactivation dormant gene long eliminated genome suppressed perhaps hundred generation lead reoccurrence trait thought lost like hindlegs dolphin teeth chicken wing wingless stick insect tail additional nipple human etc,evolution_theory
throwback known atavism natural selection within population trait vary across range value height categorised three different type,evolution_theory
first directional selection shift average value trait timefor example organism slowly getting taller,evolution_theory
secondly disruptive selection selection extreme trait value often result two different value becoming common selection average value,evolution_theory
would either short tall organism advantage medium height,evolution_theory
finally stabilising selection selection extreme trait value end cause decrease variance around average value less diversity,evolution_theory
would example cause organism eventually similar height natural selection generally make nature measure individual individual trait less likely survive,evolution_theory
nature sense refers ecosystem system organism interact every element physical well biological local environment,evolution_theory
eugene odum founder ecology defined ecosystem unit includes organismsin given area interacting physical environment flow energy lead clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity material cycle ie exchange material living nonliving part within system population within ecosystem occupies distinct niche position distinct relationship part system,evolution_theory
relationship involve life history organism position food chain geographic range,evolution_theory
broad understanding nature enables scientist delineate specific force together comprise natural selection natural selection act different level organisation gene cell individual organism group organism specie,evolution_theory
example selection occurring level individual organism gene called transposon replicate spread throughout genome,evolution_theory
selection level individual group selection may allow evolution cooperation genetic drift genetic drift random fluctuation allele frequency within population one generation next,evolution_theory
selective force absent relatively weak allele frequency equally likely drift upward downward successive generation allele subject sampling error,evolution_theory
drift halt allele eventually becomes fixed either disappearing population replacing allele entirely,evolution_theory
genetic drift may therefore eliminate allele population due chance alone,evolution_theory
even absence selective force genetic drift cause two separate population begin genetic structure drift apart two divergent population different set allele according neutral theory molecular evolution evolutionary change result fixation neutral mutation genetic drift,evolution_theory
model genetic change population thus result constant mutation pressure genetic drift,evolution_theory
form neutral theory debated since seem fit genetic variation seen nature,evolution_theory
bettersupported version model nearly neutral theory according mutation would effectively neutral small population necessarily neutral large population,evolution_theory
theory propose genetic drift dwarfed stochastic force evolution genetic hitchhiking also known genetic draft,evolution_theory
another concept constructive neutral evolution cne explains complex system emerge spread population neutral transition due principle excess capacity presuppression ratcheting applied area ranging origin spliceosome complex interdependence microbial community time take neutral allele become fixed genetic drift depends population size fixation rapid smaller population,evolution_theory
number individual population critical instead measure known effective population size,evolution_theory
effective population usually smaller total population since take account factor level inbreeding stage lifecycle population smallest,evolution_theory
effective population size may every gene population usually difficult measure relative importance selection neutral process including drift,evolution_theory
comparative importance adaptive nonadaptive force driving evolutionary change area current research mutation bias mutation bias usually conceived difference expected rate two different kind mutation eg transitiontransversion bias gcat bias deletioninsertion bias,evolution_theory
haldane fisher argued mutation weak pressure easily overcome selection tendency mutation would ineffectual except condition neutral evolution extraordinarily high mutation rate,evolution_theory
opposingpressures argument long used dismiss possibility internal tendency evolution molecular era prompted renewed interest neutral evolution noboru sueoka ernst freese proposed systematic bias mutation might responsible systematic difference genomic gc composition specie,evolution_theory
coli mutator strain along proposal neutral theory established plausibility mutational explanation molecular pattern common molecular evolution literature instance mutation bias frequently invoked model codon usage,evolution_theory
model also include effect selection following mutationselectiondrift model allows mutation bias differential selection based effect translation,evolution_theory
hypothesis mutation bias played important role development thinking evolution genome composition including isochores,evolution_theory
deletion bias different taxon lead evolution different genome size,evolution_theory
hypothesis lynch regarding genome size relies mutational bias toward increase decrease genome size however mutational hypothesis evolution composition suffered reduction scope discovered gcbiased gene conversion make important contribution composition diploid organism mammal bacterial genome frequently atbiased mutation contemporary thinking role mutation bias reflects different theory haldane fisher,evolution_theory
recent work showed original pressure theory assumes evolution based standing variation evolution depends event mutation introduce new allele mutational developmental bias introduction variation arrival bias impose bias evolution without requiring neutral evolution high mutation rate several study report mutation implicated adaptation reflect common mutation bias though others dispute interpretation genetic hitchhiking recombination allows allele strand dna become separated,evolution_theory
however rate recombination low approximately two event per chromosome per generation,evolution_theory
result gene close together chromosome may always shuffled away gene close together tend inherited together phenomenon known linkage,evolution_theory
tendency measured finding often two allele occur together single chromosome compared expectation called linkage disequilibrium,evolution_theory
set allele usually inherited group called haplotype,evolution_theory
important one allele particular haplotype strongly beneficial natural selection drive selective sweep also cause allele haplotype become common population effect called genetic hitchhiking genetic draft,evolution_theory
genetic draft caused fact neutral gene genetically linked others selection partially captured appropriate effective population size sexual selection special case natural selection sexual selection selection trait increase mating success increasing attractiveness organism potential mate,evolution_theory
trait evolved sexual selection particularly prominent among male several animal specie,evolution_theory
although sexually favoured trait cumbersome antler mating call large body size bright colour often attract predation compromise survival individual male,evolution_theory
survival disadvantage balanced higher reproductive success male show hardtofake sexually selected trait natural outcome evolution influence every aspect form behaviour organism,evolution_theory
prominent specific behavioural physical adaptation outcome natural selection,evolution_theory
adaptation increase fitness aiding activity finding food avoiding predator attracting mate,evolution_theory
organism also respond selection cooperating usually aiding relative engaging mutually beneficial symbiosis,evolution_theory
longer term evolution produce new specie splitting ancestral population organism new group interbreed,evolution_theory
outcome evolution distinguished based time scale macroevolution versus microevolution,evolution_theory
macroevolution refers evolution occurs level specie particular speciation extinction whereas microevolution refers smaller evolutionary change within specie population particular shift allele frequency adaptation,evolution_theory
thus distinction micro macroevolution fundamental onethe difference simply time involved,evolution_theory
however macroevolution trait entire specie may important,evolution_theory
instance large amount variation among individual allows specie rapidly adapt new habitat lessening chance going extinct wide geographic range increase chance speciation making likely part population become isolated,evolution_theory
sense microevolution macroevolution might involve selection different levelswith microevolution acting gene organism versus macroevolutionary process specie selection acting entire specie affecting rate speciation extinction common misconception evolution goal longterm plan innate tendency progress expressed belief orthogenesis evolutionism realistically however evolution longterm goal necessarily produce greater complexity,evolution_theory
although complex specie evolved occur side effect overall number organism increasing simple form life still remain common biosphere,evolution_theory
example overwhelming majority specie microscopic prokaryote form half world biomass despite small size constitute vast majority earth biodiversity,evolution_theory
simple organism therefore dominant form life earth throughout history continue main form life present day complex life appearing diverse noticeable,evolution_theory
indeed evolution microorganism particularly important evolutionary research since rapid reproduction allows study experimental evolution observation evolution adaptation real time adaptation adaptation process make organism better suited habitat,evolution_theory
also term adaptation may refer trait important organism survival,evolution_theory
example adaptation horse teeth grinding grass,evolution_theory
using term adaptation evolutionary process adaptive trait product bodily part function two sens word may distinguished,evolution_theory
following definition due theodosius dobzhansky adaptation evolutionary process whereby organism becomes better able live habitat habitat adaptedness state adapted degree organism able live reproduce given set habitat adaptive trait aspect developmental pattern organism enables enhances probability organism surviving reproducing adaptation may cause either gain new feature loss ancestral feature,evolution_theory
example show type change bacterial adaptation antibiotic selection genetic change causing antibiotic resistance modifying target drug increasing activity transporter pump drug cell,evolution_theory
striking example bacteria escherichia coli evolving ability use citric acid nutrient longterm laboratory experiment flavobacterium evolving novel enzyme allows bacteria grow byproduct nylon manufacturing soil bacterium sphingobium evolving entirely new metabolic pathway degrades synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol,evolution_theory
interesting still controversial idea adaptation might increase ability organism generate genetic diversity adapt natural selection increasing organism evolvability adaptation occurs gradual modification existing structure,evolution_theory
consequently structure similar internal organisation may different function related organism,evolution_theory
result single ancestral structure adapted function different way,evolution_theory
bone within bat wing example similar mouse foot primate hand due descent structure common mammalian ancestor,evolution_theory
however since living organism related extent even organ appear little structural similarity arthropod squid vertebrate eye limb wing arthropod vertebrate depend common set homologous gene control assembly function called deep homology evolution structure may lose original function become vestigial structure,evolution_theory
structure may little function current specie yet clear function ancestral specie closely related specie,evolution_theory
example include pseudogenes nonfunctional remains eye blind cavedwelling fish wing flightless bird presence hip bone whale snake sexual trait organism reproduce via asexual reproduction,evolution_theory
example vestigial structure human include wisdom teeth coccyx vermiform appendix behavioural vestige goose bump primitive reflex however many trait appear simple adaptation fact exaptations structure originally adapted one function coincidentally became somewhat useful function process,evolution_theory
one example african lizard holaspis guentheri developed extremely flat head hiding crevice seen looking near relative,evolution_theory
however specie head become flattened assist gliding tree treean exaptation,evolution_theory
within cell molecular machine bacterial flagellum protein sorting machinery evolved recruitment several preexisting protein previously different function,evolution_theory
another example recruitment enzyme glycolysis xenobiotic metabolism serve structural protein called crystallins within lens organism eye area current investigation evolutionary developmental biology developmental basis adaptation exaptations,evolution_theory
research address origin evolution embryonic development modification development developmental process produce novel feature,evolution_theory
study shown evolution alter development produce new structure embryonic bone structure develop jaw animal instead forming part middle ear mammal,evolution_theory
also possible structure lost evolution reappear due change developmental gene mutation chicken causing embryo grow teeth similar crocodile,evolution_theory
becoming clear alteration form organism due change small set conserved gene coevolution interaction organism produce conflict cooperation,evolution_theory
interaction pair specie pathogen host predator prey specie develop matched set adaptation,evolution_theory
evolution one specie cause adaptation second specie,evolution_theory
change second specie turn cause new adaptation first specie,evolution_theory
example production tetrodotoxin roughskinned newt evolution tetrodotoxin resistance predator common garter snake,evolution_theory
predatorprey pair evolutionary arm race produced high level toxin newt correspondingly high level toxin resistance snake cooperation coevolved interaction specie involve conflict,evolution_theory
instance extreme cooperation exists plant mycorrhizal fungi grow root aid plant absorbing nutrient soil,evolution_theory
reciprocal relationship plant provide fungi sugar photosynthesis,evolution_theory
fungi actually grow inside plant cell allowing exchange nutrient host sending signal suppress plant immune system coalition organism specie also evolved,evolution_theory
extreme case eusociality found social insect bee termite ant sterile insect feed guard small number organism colony able reproduce,evolution_theory
even smaller scale somatic cell make body animal limit reproduction maintain stable organism support small number animal germ cell produce offspring,evolution_theory
somatic cell respond specific signal instruct whether grow remain die,evolution_theory
cell ignore signal multiply inappropriately uncontrolled growth cause cancer cooperation within specie may evolved process kin selection one organism act help raise relative offspring,evolution_theory
activity selected helping individual contains allele promote helping activity likely kin also contain allele thus allele passed,evolution_theory
process may promote cooperation include group selection cooperation provides benefit group organism speciation speciation process specie diverges two descendant specie multiple way define concept specie,evolution_theory
choice definition dependent particularity specie concerned,evolution_theory
example specie concept apply readily toward sexually reproducing organism others lend better toward asexual organism,evolution_theory
despite diversity various specie concept various concept placed one three broad philosophical approach interbreeding ecological phylogenetic,evolution_theory
biological specie concept bsc classic example interbreeding approach,evolution_theory
defined evolutionary biologist ernst mayr bsc state specie group actually potentially interbreeding natural population reproductively isolated group despite wide longterm use bsc like specie concept without controversy example genetic recombination among prokaryote intrinsic aspect reproduction called specie problem,evolution_theory
researcher attempted unifying monistic definition specie others adopt pluralistic approach suggest may different way logically interpret definition specie barrier reproduction two diverging sexual population required population become new specie,evolution_theory
gene flow may slow process spreading new genetic variant also population,evolution_theory
depending far two specie diverged since recent common ancestor may still possible produce offspring horse donkey mating produce mule,evolution_theory
case closely related specie may regularly interbreed hybrid selected specie remain distinct,evolution_theory
however viable hybrid occasionally formed new specie either property intermediate parent specie possess totally new phenotype,evolution_theory
importance hybridisation producing new specie animal unclear although case seen many type animal gray tree frog particularly wellstudied example speciation observed multiple time controlled laboratory condition nature,evolution_theory
sexually reproducing organism speciation result reproductive isolation followed genealogical divergence,evolution_theory
common animal allopatric speciation occurs population initially isolated geographically habitat fragmentation migration,evolution_theory
selection condition produce rapid change appearance behaviour organism,evolution_theory
selection drift act independently population isolated rest specie separation may eventually produce organism interbreed second mode speciation peripatric speciation occurs small population organism become isolated new environment,evolution_theory
differs allopatric speciation isolated population numerically much smaller parental population,evolution_theory
founder effect cause rapid speciation increase inbreeding increase selection homozygote leading rapid genetic change third mode parapatric speciation,evolution_theory
similar peripatric speciation small population enters new habitat differs physical separation two population,evolution_theory
instead speciation result evolution mechanism reduce gene flow two population,evolution_theory
generally occurs drastic change environment within parental specie habitat,evolution_theory
one example grass anthoxanthum odoratum undergo parapatric speciation response localised metal pollution mine,evolution_theory
plant evolve resistance high level metal soil,evolution_theory
selection interbreeding metalsensitive parental population produced gradual change flowering time metalresistant plant eventually produced complete reproductive isolation,evolution_theory
selection hybrid two population may cause reinforcement evolution trait promote mating within specie well character displacement two specie become distinct appearance finally sympatric speciation specie diverge without geographic isolation change habitat,evolution_theory
form rare since even small amount gene flow may remove genetic difference part population,evolution_theory
generally sympatric speciation animal requires evolution genetic difference nonrandom mating allow reproductive isolation evolve one type sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding two related specie produce new hybrid specie,evolution_theory
common animal animal hybrid usually sterile,evolution_theory
meiosis homologous chromosome parent different specie successfully pair,evolution_theory
however common plant plant often double number chromosome form polyploid,evolution_theory
allows chromosome parental specie form matching pair meiosis since parent chromosome represented pair already,evolution_theory
example speciation event plant specie arabidopsis thaliana arabidopsis arenosa crossbred give new specie arabidopsis suecica,evolution_theory
happened year ago speciation process repeated laboratory allows study genetic mechanism involved process,evolution_theory
indeed chromosome doubling within specie may common cause reproductive isolation half doubled chromosome unmatched breeding undoubled organism speciation event important theory punctuated equilibrium account pattern fossil record short burst evolution interspersed relatively long period stasis specie remain relatively unchanged,evolution_theory
theory speciation rapid evolution linked natural selection genetic drift acting strongly organism undergoing speciation novel habitat small population,evolution_theory
result period stasis fossil record correspond parental population organism undergoing speciation rapid evolution found small population geographically restricted habitat therefore rarely preserved fossil extinction extinction disappearance entire specie,evolution_theory
extinction unusual event specie regularly appear speciation disappear extinction,evolution_theory
nearly animal plant specie lived earth extinct extinction appears ultimate fate specie,evolution_theory
extinction happened continuously throughout history life although rate extinction spike occasional mass extinction event,evolution_theory
cretaceouspaleogene extinction event nonavian dinosaur became extinct wellknown earlier permiantriassic extinction event even severe approximately marine specie driven extinction,evolution_theory
holocene extinction event ongoing mass extinction associated humanity expansion across globe past thousand year,evolution_theory
presentday extinction rate time greater background rate current specie may extinct mid st century,evolution_theory
human activity primary cause ongoing extinction event global warming may accelerate future,evolution_theory
despite estimated extinction specie ever lived earth trillion specie estimated earth currently onethousandth described role extinction evolution well understood may depend type extinction considered,evolution_theory
cause continuous lowlevel extinction event form majority extinction may result competition specie limited resource competitive exclusion principle,evolution_theory
one specie outcompete another could produce specie selection fitter specie surviving specie driven extinction,evolution_theory
intermittent mass extinction also important instead acting selective force drastically reduce diversity nonspecific manner promote burst rapid evolution speciation survivor application concept model used evolutionary biology natural selection many application artificial selection intentional selection trait population organism,evolution_theory

mutation part genome deleterious vast majority neutral,evolution_theory
beneficial mutation involve large section chromosome becoming duplicated usually genetic recombination introduce extra copy gene genome,evolution_theory
extra copy gene major source raw material needed new gene evolve,evolution_theory
important new gene evolve within gene family preexisting gene share common ancestor,evolution_theory
example human eye us four gene make structure sense light three colour vision one night vision four descended single ancestral gene new gene generated ancestral gene duplicate copy mutates acquires new function,evolution_theory

consequently organism trait give advantage competitor likely pas trait next generation trait confer advantage,evolution_theory
teleonomy quality whereby process natural selection creates preserve trait seemingly fitted functional role perform,evolution_theory
consequence selection include nonrandom mating genetic hitchhiking central concept natural selection evolutionary fitness organism,evolution_theory
fitness measured organism ability survive reproduce determines size genetic contribution next generation,evolution_theory
however fitness total number offspring instead fitness indicated proportion subsequent generation carry organism gene,evolution_theory
example organism could survive well reproduce rapidly offspring small weak survive organism would make little genetic contribution future generation would thus low fitness allele increase fitness allele gene generation allele higher probability becoming common within population,evolution_theory
trait said selected example trait increase fitness enhanced survival increased fecundity,evolution_theory
conversely lower fitness caused less beneficial deleterious allele result allele likely becoming rarerthey selected importantly fitness allele fixed characteristic environment change previously neutral harmful trait may become beneficial previously beneficial trait become harmful,evolution_theory

however reactivation dormant gene long eliminated genome suppressed perhaps hundred generation lead reoccurrence trait thought lost like hindlegs dolphin teeth chicken wing wingless stick insect tail additional nipple human etc,evolution_theory
throwback known atavism natural selection within population trait vary across range value height categorised three different type,evolution_theory
first directional selection shift average value trait timefor example organism slowly getting taller,evolution_theory
secondly disruptive selection selection extreme trait value often result two different value becoming common selection average value,evolution_theory
would either short tall organism advantage medium height,evolution_theory
finally stabilising selection selection extreme trait value end cause decrease variance around average value less diversity,evolution_theory
would example cause organism eventually similar height natural selection generally make nature measure individual individual trait less likely survive,evolution_theory

selection level individual group selection may allow evolution cooperation genetic drift genetic drift random fluctuation allele frequency within population one generation next,evolution_theory
selective force absent relatively weak allele frequency equally likely drift upward downward successive generation allele subject sampling error,evolution_theory
drift halt allele eventually becomes fixed either disappearing population replacing allele entirely,evolution_theory
genetic drift may therefore eliminate allele population due chance alone,evolution_theory
even absence selective force genetic drift cause two separate population begin genetic structure drift apart two divergent population different set allele according neutral theory molecular evolution evolutionary change result fixation neutral mutation genetic drift,evolution_theory
model genetic change population thus result constant mutation pressure genetic drift,evolution_theory
form neutral theory debated since seem fit genetic variation seen nature,evolution_theory

hypothesis mutation bias played important role development thinking evolution genome composition including isochores,evolution_theory
deletion bias different taxon lead evolution different genome size,evolution_theory
hypothesis lynch regarding genome size relies mutational bias toward increase decrease genome size however mutational hypothesis evolution composition suffered reduction scope discovered gcbiased gene conversion make important contribution composition diploid organism mammal bacterial genome frequently atbiased mutation contemporary thinking role mutation bias reflects different theory haldane fisher,evolution_theory
recent work showed original pressure theory assumes evolution based standing variation evolution depends event mutation introduce new allele mutational developmental bias introduction variation arrival bias impose bias evolution without requiring neutral evolution high mutation rate several study report mutation implicated adaptation reflect common mutation bias though others dispute interpretation genetic hitchhiking recombination allows allele strand dna become separated,evolution_theory
however rate recombination low approximately two event per chromosome per generation,evolution_theory
result gene close together chromosome may always shuffled away gene close together tend inherited together phenomenon known linkage,evolution_theory
tendency measured finding often two allele occur together single chromosome compared expectation called linkage disequilibrium,evolution_theory
set allele usually inherited group called haplotype,evolution_theory
important one allele particular haplotype strongly beneficial natural selection drive selective sweep also cause allele haplotype become common population effect called genetic hitchhiking genetic draft,evolution_theory
genetic draft caused fact neutral gene genetically linked others selection partially captured appropriate effective population size sexual selection special case natural selection sexual selection selection trait increase mating success increasing attractiveness organism potential mate,evolution_theory
trait evolved sexual selection particularly prominent among male several animal specie,evolution_theory
although sexually favoured trait cumbersome antler mating call large body size bright colour often attract predation compromise survival individual male,evolution_theory
survival disadvantage balanced higher reproductive success male show hardtofake sexually selected trait natural outcome evolution influence every aspect form behaviour organism,evolution_theory
prominent specific behavioural physical adaptation outcome natural selection,evolution_theory
adaptation increase fitness aiding activity finding food avoiding predator attracting mate,evolution_theory
organism also respond selection cooperating usually aiding relative engaging mutually beneficial symbiosis,evolution_theory
longer term evolution produce new specie splitting ancestral population organism new group interbreed,evolution_theory
outcome evolution distinguished based time scale macroevolution versus microevolution,evolution_theory
macroevolution refers evolution occurs level specie particular speciation extinction whereas microevolution refers smaller evolutionary change within specie population particular shift allele frequency adaptation,evolution_theory
thus distinction micro macroevolution fundamental onethe difference simply time involved,evolution_theory
however macroevolution trait entire specie may important,evolution_theory
instance large amount variation among individual allows specie rapidly adapt new habitat lessening chance going extinct wide geographic range increase chance speciation making likely part population become isolated,evolution_theory
sense microevolution macroevolution might involve selection different levelswith microevolution acting gene organism versus macroevolutionary process specie selection acting entire specie affecting rate speciation extinction common misconception evolution goal longterm plan innate tendency progress expressed belief orthogenesis evolutionism realistically however evolution longterm goal necessarily produce greater complexity,evolution_theory
although complex specie evolved occur side effect overall number organism increasing simple form life still remain common biosphere,evolution_theory

simple organism therefore dominant form life earth throughout history continue main form life present day complex life appearing diverse noticeable,evolution_theory
indeed evolution microorganism particularly important evolutionary research since rapid reproduction allows study experimental evolution observation evolution adaptation real time adaptation adaptation process make organism better suited habitat,evolution_theory
also term adaptation may refer trait important organism survival,evolution_theory

consequently structure similar internal organisation may different function related organism,evolution_theory

however since living organism related extent even organ appear little structural similarity arthropod squid vertebrate eye limb wing arthropod vertebrate depend common set homologous gene control assembly function called deep homology evolution structure may lose original function become vestigial structure,evolution_theory

even smaller scale somatic cell make body animal limit reproduction maintain stable organism support small number animal germ cell produce offspring,evolution_theory
somatic cell respond specific signal instruct whether grow remain die,evolution_theory
cell ignore signal multiply inappropriately uncontrolled growth cause cancer cooperation within specie may evolved process kin selection one organism act help raise relative offspring,evolution_theory
