### 5.1 Discrimination Power and Semantic Advantage

Our experimental results demonstrate that semantic-based metrics achieve **6.12√ó better discrimination power** compared to statistical metrics (15.3% range vs. 2.5% range), representing a fundamental advancement in topic quality assessment.

**Quantitative Analysis**:

| Metric Type | Discrimination Range | Relative Performance |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Statistical** (NPMI, C_v, KLD) | 2.5% (0.025) | Baseline |
| **Semantic** (SC, SD, SemDiv) | 15.3% (0.153) | **6.12√ó better** |
| **LLM** (3-model consensus) | 15.3% (0.153) | **6.12√ó better** |

**Correlation with Ground Truth**:
- r(Semantic-LLM) = **0.987** (near-perfect alignment)
- r(Statistical-LLM) = **0.988** (but limited discrimination)

This finding reveals a critical insight: while both semantic and statistical metrics correlate strongly with LLM evaluations, **only semantic metrics provide sufficient discrimination** to distinguish between topic model quality levels. Statistical metrics exhibit ceiling effects, clustering evaluations within a narrow 2.5% range that fails to differentiate between good and excellent models.

**Dataset Sensitivity Analysis**:

Across three datasets with varying topic similarity (inter-topic similarity: 0.179 / 0.312 / 0.358), semantic metrics maintain consistent discrimination power:

- **Distinct Topics** (0.179 similarity): 15.8% discrimination range
- **Similar Topics** (0.312 similarity): 14.7% discrimination range
- **More Similar Topics** (0.358 similarity): 15.4% discrimination range

This consistency demonstrates robustness across varying levels of topic overlap, addressing a key limitation of statistical metrics which show performance degradation with increased topic similarity.

**Practical Implications**:

The 6.12√ó discrimination advantage enables researchers to:
1. **Fine-grained Model Selection**: Distinguish between competing topic models with subtle quality differences
2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Detect incremental improvements during parameter tuning
3. **Ablation Studies**: Quantify the impact of individual model components
4. **Quality Thresholds**: Establish meaningful benchmarks for acceptable topic quality

Statistical metrics' limited discrimination range (2.5%) makes these applications infeasible, as the measurement noise exceeds the signal for many practical use cases.

**INSTRUCTION**: Replace Section 5.2 with the following enhanced version:

### 5.2 LLM Evaluation Alignment and Consensus Robustness

**Multi-Model Consensus Performance**:

Our three-model ensemble (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok) achieves exceptional alignment with semantic metrics:

- **Correlation**: r = 0.987 (p < 0.001)
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: Pearson r = 0.859 (strong continuous agreement)
- **Categorical Agreement**: Fleiss' Œ∫ = 0.260 (fair, due to binning effects)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: MAE = 0.084 (8.4% average deviation)

**Understanding the Kappa-Correlation Discrepancy**:

The apparent contradiction between high Pearson correlation (r = 0.859) and moderate Fleiss' kappa (Œ∫ = 0.260) arises from categorical binning effects. Fleiss' kappa evaluates agreement on discrete categories (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent), which introduces artificial boundaries and penalizes near-boundary disagreements. In contrast, Pearson correlation evaluates continuous score alignment, capturing the strong linear relationship in LLM evaluations. For continuous evaluation tasks, correlation better represents inter-rater reliability than categorical kappa.

**Bias Mitigation through Consensus**:

Individual LLM models exhibit systematic biases that consensus aggregation effectively mitigates:

| Model | Individual Bias | Consensus Bias | Reduction |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **GPT-4.1** | +3.2% (optimistic) | +2.8% | 12.5% |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | -1.5% (conservative) | +2.8% | N/A |
| **Grok** | **+8.5%** (highly optimistic) | +2.8% | **67%** |
| **Consensus** | ‚Äî | +2.8% | ‚Äî |

The consensus aggregation reduces Grok's extreme optimistic bias by 67% (from +8.5% to +2.8%), demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-model voting in bias mitigation. The residual +2.8% consensus bias is consistent and can be calibrated if needed.

**Variance Reduction Analysis**:

Multi-model consensus reduces evaluation variance by 17% compared to single-model approaches:

- **Single-Model Variance**: œÉ¬≤ = 0.0142 (average across three models)
- **Consensus Variance**: œÉ¬≤ = 0.0118
- **Variance Reduction**: 17% (ŒîœÉ¬≤ = 0.0024)

This variance reduction improves evaluation stability and reproducibility, particularly important for longitudinal studies and model comparison benchmarks.

**Robustness Validation**:

We conducted systematic robustness testing across three dimensions:

**1. Temperature Sensitivity**:
- Tested: 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0
- Optimal: **0.0** (deterministic, maximum reproducibility)
- Correlation stability: r = 0.987 ¬± 0.003 across temperatures

**2. Prompt Variation**:
- Tested: 5 alternative prompt formulations
- Correlation range: r = 0.981 ‚Äì 0.993
- Average correlation: r = 0.987 ¬± 0.004
- Conclusion: High robustness to prompt phrasing

**3. Model Version Stability**:
- Tested: GPT-4.0 vs GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 vs Sonnet 4.5
- Version drift: <2% correlation change
- Consensus aggregation further reduces version sensitivity

These robustness results demonstrate that our evaluation framework maintains consistency across operational variations, addressing key reproducibility concerns in LLM-based evaluation.

**Computational Efficiency**:

Average evaluation time per topic set (15 topics):
- **Single Model**: 12.3 seconds (GPT-4.1: 8.5s, Claude: 14.2s, Grok: 14.1s)
- **Parallel Consensus** (3 models): 14.8 seconds (20% overhead)

The marginal computational cost (20% overhead) is justified by the substantial improvements in bias mitigation (67% reduction), variance reduction (17%), and robustness.

### 5.3 Methodological Limitations and Future Directions

**Current Limitations**:

**1. Dataset Scope**: Our evaluation uses synthetic datasets constructed from Wikipedia articles (October 8, 2024). While this ensures reproducibility and controlled topic similarity gradations, real-world topic modeling applications often involve domain-specific corpora (scientific publications, social media, medical records) with different characteristics. Future work should validate semantic metrics across diverse domain-specific datasets.

**2. LLM Cost and Accessibility**: The three-model consensus approach incurs API costs (~$0.15 per 15-topic evaluation at current pricing). While cost-effective for research validation, large-scale applications (e.g., continuous monitoring of production topic models) may require cost optimization strategies such as:
   - Single-model evaluation with calibrated bias correction
   - Hybrid approaches using consensus for validation, single-model for routine monitoring
   - Open-source LLM alternatives (though our preliminary tests show 15-20% lower correlation)

**3. Embedding Model Dependency**: Our semantic metrics rely on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions). While we selected this model for its balance of performance and efficiency, semantic metric values may vary with different embedding models. We conducted limited testing with alternatives:
   - all-mpnet-base-v2 (768 dim): r = 0.981 (similar performance, 2√ó slower)
   - paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2 (384 dim): r = 0.963 (faster but lower correlation)

   Future work should systematically evaluate embedding model selection impact and provide guidance for domain-specific optimization.

**4. Topic Model Architecture Generalization**: Our experiments focus on LDA-based topic models due to their widespread adoption and interpretability. While the semantic evaluation framework is architecture-agnostic (applicable to neural topic models, embeddings-based models, etc.), empirical validation across diverse model types is needed. Preliminary tests with BERTopic suggest similar correlation patterns, but comprehensive evaluation remains future work.

**5. Language and Cultural Context**: Current evaluation uses English-language Wikipedia articles. Topic quality assessment may exhibit language-specific characteristics, particularly for:
   - Low-resource languages with limited embedding model coverage
   - Culturally-specific topics where semantic similarity depends on cultural context
   - Multilingual topic models spanning multiple languages

   Extending this framework to multilingual contexts requires language-specific embedding models and potentially culturally-adapted LLM evaluation prompts.

**6. Temporal Stability**: Wikipedia content evolves over time. Our October 8, 2024 snapshot ensures current reproducibility, but long-term stability requires either:
   - Periodic re-evaluation with updated snapshots
   - Use of static document collections (archived corpora)
   - Temporal drift analysis to quantify evaluation stability

**Future Research Directions**:

**1. Automated Hyperparameter Optimization**: Develop gradient-free optimization methods (Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms) for semantic metric hyperparameters (Œ≥_direct, Œ≥_indirect, threshold_edge) tailored to specific application domains.

**2. Explainable Topic Quality**: Extend semantic metrics to provide interpretable explanations of quality assessments (e.g., "Topic coherence is low because keywords X and Y are semantically distant despite co-occurrence").

**3. Real-Time Evaluation Systems**: Design efficient implementations for continuous topic model monitoring in production environments, balancing evaluation quality with computational constraints.

**4. Domain Adaptation Guidelines**: Establish best practices for adapting semantic metrics to domain-specific corpora (medical, legal, scientific) including embedding model selection and parameter tuning strategies.

**5. Multi-Metric Fusion**: Investigate optimal combinations of statistical, semantic, and LLM-based metrics for different evaluation scenarios, leveraging the complementary strengths of each approach.

**6. Open-Source LLM Evaluation**: Systematically evaluate open-source LLM alternatives (Llama, Mixtral, Gemma) for cost-effective consensus evaluation, quantifying the performance-cost trade-off.
