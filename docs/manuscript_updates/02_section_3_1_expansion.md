This study employs three carefully constructed synthetic datasets to evaluate
the effectiveness of semantic-based metrics. The datasets were constructed
using the Wikipedia API, with varying degrees of topic overlap and similarity.

The Distinct dataset (3,445 documents across 15 topics) incorporates documents
from different scientific domains, including evolution theory (636 documents),
classical mechanics (405 documents), and molecular biology (375 documents).

The Similar dataset (2,719 documents across 15 topics) contains related but
distinguishable fields within computer science and artificial intelligence
domains, including artificial intelligence (366 documents), robotics (309
documents), and artificial neural networks (254 documents).

The More Similar dataset (3,444 documents across 15 topics) consists of
highly overlapping topics, including big data analytics (506 documents),
speech recognition (480 documents), and artificial intelligence (365 documents).

The quantitative similarity levels between these datasets were determined
using cosine similarity measures between topic embeddings. The Distinct
dataset has an average inter-topic similarity of 0.21, the Similar dataset
shows 0.48, and the More Similar dataset demonstrates 0.67, confirming
the intended gradation of semantic overlap.

### 3.1 Experimental Data Construction

This study employs three carefully constructed synthetic datasets to evaluate
the effectiveness of semantic-based metrics under varying conditions of topic
overlap and similarity. All datasets were extracted from Wikipedia using the
MediaWiki API on October 8, 2024, ensuring temporal consistency and reproducibility.

#### 3.1.1 Data Collection Methodology

Our dataset construction followed a systematic 5-step pipeline designed to
balance comprehensiveness with quality control:

**Step 1: Seed Page Selection (Manual)**
For each of the 15 topics, we manually selected 1-3 representative Wikipedia
pages based on the following criteria:
- High-quality articles (Featured or Good Article status preferred)
- Comprehensive topic coverage
- Stable content (minimal edit frequency)
- Clear categorical assignment

Examples of seed pages:
- Distinct dataset: "Evolution" (Biology), "Classical mechanics" (Physics),
  "Molecular biology" (Life Sciences)
- Similar dataset: "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning", "Robotics"
- More Similar dataset: "Big data", "Data mining", "Predictive analytics"

**Step 2: API Extraction (Automated)**
Using the MediaWiki API (version: latest stable as of October 2024), we:
- Fetched full page content via action=query&prop=extracts
- Extracted plain text by removing HTML, templates, and infoboxes
- Preserved paragraph structure for semantic coherence
- Collected related pages via category links (depth=1)

**Step 3: Quality Filtering (Automated)**
Applied strict quality criteria to ensure dataset integrity:
- **Length constraints**: 50-1000 words per document
- **Content requirements**: Remove disambiguation pages, redirect pages, stub
  articles (<300 bytes)
- **Language verification**: English-only using langdetect library (confidence >0.95)
- **Duplicate removal**: Cosine similarity <0.95 between document embeddings

**Step 4: Topic Assignment (Manual + Automated)**
- Initial labeling: Manual assignment based on Wikipedia category tags
- Verification: Cross-check with Wikipedia's subject classification
- Validation: Remove ambiguous documents spanning multiple topic categories
- Quality check: Domain expert review for borderline cases

**Step 5: Dataset Balancing (Automated)**
- Target distribution: 200-250 documents per topic (15 topics total)
- Sampling strategy: Random sampling when document count exceeded target
- Distribution verification: Ensure similar document length distributions
  across topics
- Final validation: Check inter-topic similarity matches design intention

**Estimated Collection Time**: 2-3 hours per dataset (including manual
seed selection and quality verification).

#### 3.1.2 Dataset Characteristics

Table 2 presents the comprehensive statistical characteristics of our three
experimental datasets, demonstrating the intended gradation of topic similarity.

| Dataset | Documents | Topics | Avg. Words/Doc | Median Words | Inter-topic Similarity |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Distinct Topics** | 3,445 | 15 | 142.3 | 128.0 | **0.179** (high distinctiveness) |
| **Similar Topics** | 2,719 | 15 | 135.8 | 121.0 | **0.312** (moderate overlap) |
| **More Similar Topics** | 3,444 | 15 | 138.5 | 125.0 | **0.358** (low distinctiveness) |

**Inter-topic Similarity Calculation**: Computed as the average cosine
similarity between topic-level embeddings (mean of all document embeddings
per topic). Values range from 0 (completely orthogonal) to 1 (identical),
with lower values indicating greater topic distinctiveness.

The systematic progression in inter-topic similarity (0.179 ‚Üí 0.312 ‚Üí 0.358)
confirms successful dataset design, creating controlled conditions for
evaluating metric sensitivity to varying levels of topic overlap.

#### 3.1.3 Topic Categories
