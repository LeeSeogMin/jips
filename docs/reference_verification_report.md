   - **Issue**: Could not locate in EMNLP 2023 proceedings
   - **Page range 10051-10065** seems implausibly high for EMNLP
   - **Action**: Replace with real LLM evaluation paper or remove

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Priority Verification Issues**:

2. **[2] Grootendorst IEEE (2022)** - BERTopic is real, but IEEE publication details uncertain
3. **[3] Grootendorst ArXiv (2022)** - Need to verify ArXiv ID: 2203.05794
4. **Recent papers [16-23]** - All 2022-2024 papers need systematic verification

## Immediate Action Required

### üîÑ **Replace Problematic References**

If [15] Stammbach cannot be verified, consider these real alternatives:

- Use actual LLM evaluation papers from EMNLP 2023/2024
- Reference recent survey papers on neural topic models
- Cite established coherence evaluation papers

### ‚úÖ **Maintain High-Quality Standards**

Keep these verified/reliable references:

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**:

   - Verify high-impact papers with potentially incorrect details
   - Check ArXiv numbers for accuracy
   - Confirm recent publication years

2. **Academic Database Search**:

   - Use Google Scholar, DBLP, and Semantic Scholar for verification
   - Cross-reference with conference/journal websites
