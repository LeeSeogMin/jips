  "response": "ALL_ISSUES_RESOLVED\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nA thorough review of the manuscript against the provided reviewer comments reveals that all major and minor issues have been addressed. The manuscript includes:\n\n- **Consistent and unified reporting of all key statistics** (e.g., Cohen’s κ, correlation coefficients) across abstract, body, conclusion, and appendices, with explanations for any differences and references to scripts and summary tables.\n- **Detailed reproducibility and methodological information**:  \n  - Embedding model, tokenizer, preprocessing, and hyperparameters are fully specified (Section 3.2.3, 3.3.2.1, and code references).\n  - LLM call details (model/version, API parameters, deterministic sampling, aggregation, pseudo-code/scripts for score conversion and κ calculation) are provided in Section 3.3.3 and Appendix A.\n  - Dataset construction is described step-by-step (Section 3.1), with crawl date, seed page criteria, filtering, and a promise to release code and data (Section 6.4, Appendices C/D).\n- **Metric definitions and normalization**:  \n  - All custom metrics (Semantic Coherence, Distinctiveness, SemDiv with α/β/γ/λ) are mathematically specified, with parameter values, grid search justification, and toy worked examples (Section 3.3.2, Appendix B).\n- **LLM evaluation limitations and robustness**:  \n  - Bias, hallucination, and robustness are discussed (Sections 2.5, 5.2), with sensitivity analyses (temperature, prompt, model), multi-model consensus, and mitigation strategies.\n- **Table/figure clarity, terminology, code, language, and conclusion alignment**:  \n  - Table/figure captions, headers, and takeaways are present; t-SNE hyperparameters and UMAP comparison are mentioned.\n  - All abbreviations are defined on first use.\n  - Appendix code and pseudo-code are included, with runnable examples referenced.\n  - Language is polished and redundant/formatting issues are minimal.\n  - Conclusion matches body/abstract numerics and limitations, with explicit future work.\n- **Second reviewer’s requests**:  \n  - At least one public real-world dataset is included (Wikipedia, with open release promised).\n  - Related work and Ref. 15 are clarified in Section 2.5.\n  - Metric details (embedding model, λw, α/β/γ) are specified in Section 3.3.2.1.\n  - Numeric inconsistencies are resolved.\n\n**No remaining issues or missing corrections were found.**  \nAll reviewer comments have been substantively and specifically addressed in the manuscript text.\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH",
