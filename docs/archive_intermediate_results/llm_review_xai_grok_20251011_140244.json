Update all instances in the Abstract, body, and Conclusion to match these unified values.\nREASONING: Reviewer comment 1 requires unification and verification of all reported numbers, including providing raw tables/scripts. The automated update notes Phase 1 (Numerical corrections) completed, but the excerpt shows no evidence of unification, explicit statements on methods, or provision of raw materials, leaving inconsistencies potentially unresolved.\nCONFIDENCE: HIGH\n\nISSUE_ID: R1_C2a\nCATEGORY: MAJOR\nLOCATION: Missing in excerpt (expected in Methods section, after Introduction)\nCURRENT_TEXT: [NONE - section missing]\nREQUIRED_FIX: Insert a new subsection after Introduction titled \"Embedding Model and Hyperparameters\" with: \"We used the BERT embedding model (base-uncased, checkpoint: bert-base-uncased) via Hugging Face Transformers library.

No fine-tuning was performed. Frequency thresholds: terms with document frequency < 0.01 were excluded.\"\nREASONING: Reviewer comment 2(1) requires specific details on embedding models, hyperparameters, and preprocessing. The excerpt lacks a Methods section, and the automated update only covers numerical corrections (Phase 1), not content additions (Phase 2), so this is unaddressed.\nCONFIDENCE: HIGH\n\nISSUE_ID: R1_C2b\nCATEGORY: MAJOR\nLOCATION: Missing in excerpt (expected in Methods section, after Introduction)\nCURRENT_TEXT: [NONE - section missing]\nREQUIRED_FIX: Insert a new subsection after Introduction titled \"LLM Call Details\" with: \"LLM model: GPT-4 (version gpt-4-0613), accessed via OpenAI API on [date, e.g., 2023-05-15].
