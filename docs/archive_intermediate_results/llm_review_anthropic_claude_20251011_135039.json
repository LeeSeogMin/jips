Verify all numerical values are consistent across abstract, body, tables, and conclusion. Create a supplementary table listing every reported statistic with its location in the manuscript.\n**REASONING:** Reviewer explicitly noted inconsistent numbers appearing in different sections. The abstract contains no specific numerical results, making verification impossible. All Cohen's κ, correlation coefficients, and other statistics must be unified.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_C2_EMBEDDING_MODEL\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Methods section (not visible in excerpt, but required)\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"hybrid approaches using BERT embeddings\" (Introduction, paragraph 2)\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add complete specification: \"We used [exact model name, e.g., 'bert-base-uncased' from HuggingFace transformers v4.XX], checkpoint [specific version/date], with the following preprocessing: [lowercase: yes/no, stopwords: removed/retained using NLTK stopwords list, lemmatization: yes/no using spaCy v3.X, frequency threshold: minimum X occurrences]. Tokenizer settings: [max_length=512, padding=True, truncation=True]. No fine-tuning was performed on the pre-trained model.\"\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 2(1) explicitly requires exact embedding model specification with all hyperparameters and preprocessing steps. Current text only mentions \"BERT embeddings\" generically.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_C2_LLM_DETAILS\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Methods section (not visible in excerpt)\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"We further validate our findings through Large Language Models (LLMs) serving as proxy domain experts\" (Abstract)\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add complete LLM methodology section including: \"LLM Model: [e.g., GPT-4, API version gpt-4-0613], API calls made on [date range]. Parameters: temperature=X.X, top_p=X.X, max_tokens=XXX, seed=[value for deterministic sampling]. Each topic-keyword pair was evaluated N times. Continuous scores (range 0-10) were aggregated using [mean/median], then converted to categorical labels using thresholds: [1-3='poor', 4-6='moderate', 7-10='good']. Cohen's κ was calculated on these categorical labels using [sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score]. See Supplementary Code S1 for complete implementation.\"\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 2(2) requires exact LLM specifications, API parameters, evaluation protocol, and score-to-category conversion method with pseudo-code.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_C2_DATASET_DETAILS\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Methods/Data section (not visible in excerpt)\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"three synthetic datasets designed to represent varying degrees of topic overlap\" (Abstract)\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add dataset construction section: \"Synthetic datasets were constructed as follows: [generation method]. For Wikipedia-derived data (if applicable): crawl date [YYYY-MM-DD], seed queries/page lists [provide list], filtering rules [minimum length X words, language=English, excluded categories: Y, Z]. Example documents: Topic 1 (Low overlap): [Document 1: 'text...', Document 2: 'text...']; Topic 2 (Medium overlap): [...]; Topic 3 (High overlap): [...]. Dataset available at [URL] or reproducible via code at [GitHub link].\"\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 2(3) requires crawl dates, query seeds, filtering rules, example documents, and dataset availability or reproduction code.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_C3_METRIC_FORMULAS\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Methods section (not visible in excerpt)\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"novel semantic-based evaluation metrics\" (Abstract)\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add complete mathematical specifications: \n\n\"**Semantic Coherence (SC):** \nSC = (1/|T|) Σ_{t∈T} (1/|K_t|(|K_t|-1)) Σ_{i,j∈K_t, i≠j} cos(e_i, e_j)\nwhere T is the set of topics, K_t is the keyword set for topic t, e_i is the embedding vector for keyword i.\n\n**Semantic Distinctiveness (SD):**\nSD = 1 - (1/(|T|(|T|-1))) Σ_{t1,t2∈T, t1≠t2} max_{k1∈K_{t1}, k2∈K_{t2}} cos(e_{k1}, e_{k2})\n\n**SemDiv:**\nSemDiv = α·SC + β·SD + γ·[third component] - λ·[penalty term]\nParameter values: α=0.4, β=0.3, γ=0.2, λ=0.1 [justify based on pilot study/grid search]\nValue ranges: SC ∈ [0,1], SD ∈ [0,1], SemDiv ∈ [0,1]\n\n**Worked Example:**\nGiven 2 topics with 3 keywords each:\nTopic 1: ['neural', 'network', 'learning'], embeddings: [[0.1,0.2,...], [0.15,0.25,...], [0.12,0.22,...]]\nTopic 2: ['car', 'vehicle', 'drive'], embeddings: [[0.8,0.1,...], [0.82,0.12,...], [0.79,0.11,...]]\nStep 1: Calculate pairwise cosine similarities within Topic 1...\n[complete calculation showing final SC=0.XX, SD=0.XX, SemDiv=0.XX]\"\n\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 3 requires precise formulas, parameter values with justification, value ranges, and worked examples for all custom metrics.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_C4_LLM_LIMITATIONS\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Discussion section (not visible in excerpt)\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** [Not visible in excerpt]\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add dedicated subsection \"4.X Limitations of LLM-Based Evaluation\" discussing: (1) Potential biases in LLM training data affecting domain expert proxy validity, (2) Variability in LLM responses across API calls (report variance statistics), (3) Cost and reproducibility constraints, (4) Comparison with actual human expert evaluation (if available) or acknowledgment of this limitation, (5) Generalizability concerns across different domains, (6) Temporal validity (LLM knowledge cutoff dates).\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 4 (truncated but clearly about LLM evaluation limitations) requires thorough discussion of LLM validation methodology limitations.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_AUTOMATED_UPDATE_NOTE\n**CATEGORY:** MINOR\n**LOCATION:** Header section\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"AUTOMATED UPDATE APPLIED: 2025-10-11 11:40:59\nPhase 1 (Numerical corrections) completed.\nPhase 2 (Content additions) requires manual application.\nSee MANUAL_UPDATE_STEPS.md for instructions.\"\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Remove this automated update notice from the manuscript. This is internal revision tracking that should not appear in the submitted document.\n**REASONING:** This appears to be revision control metadata that should be removed before final submission.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_AFFILIATION_INCOMPLETE\n**CATEGORY:** MINOR\n**LOCATION:** Author section\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"Seog-Min Lee1\"\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add complete affiliation: \"Seog-Min Lee¹\n¹[Department Name], [Institution Name], [City, Country]\nEmail: [corresponding email]\"\n**REASONING:** Standard manuscript format requires complete author affiliations and contact information.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_REPRODUCIBILITY_STATEMENT\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** End of Methods or separate Data Availability section\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** [Not present in excerpt]\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add section: \"**Code and Data Availability:** All code for metric computation, LLM evaluation, and experiments is available at [GitHub repository URL]. Raw data, preprocessing scripts, and computed results are available at [data repository DOI]. Detailed instructions for reproduction are provided in README.md. LLM evaluation prompts and response logs are included in supplementary materials.\"\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 2 emphasizes reproducibility throughout. A clear availability statement addresses multiple reviewer concerns about scripts, datasets, and methodology transparency.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## ISSUE_ID: R1_PARAMETER_JUSTIFICATION\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Methods section, metric definitions\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** \"SemDiv with α/β/γ/λ parameters\" (mentioned in reviewer comments as needing justification)\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** Add: \"Parameter selection for SemDiv (α=X.X, β=X.X, γ=X.X, λ=X.X) was determined through [grid search over ranges α∈[0,1], β∈[0,1], γ∈[0,1], λ∈[0,1] with step 0.1 / pilot study with N validation topics / based on prior work [citation]]. Optimal values maximized [correlation with human judgments / separation between high/low quality topics in validation set]. Sensitivity analysis (see Supplementary Figure SX) shows results are robust to ±0.1 parameter variation.\"\n**REASONING:** Reviewer Comment 3 explicitly requests justification for parameter values. Arbitrary parameters undermine metric validity.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n**STATUS:** MAJOR ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED\n\nThe manuscript excerpt shows that critical revisions requested by the reviewer have NOT been adequately addressed:\n\n1. **Numerical consistency** (R1_C1): Cannot verify from excerpt, but abstract lacks specific numbers\n2. **Reproducibility details** (R1_C2): No visible embedding model specs, LLM details, or dataset construction information\n3. **Metric specifications** (R1_C3): No mathematical formulas, parameter values, or worked examples visible\n4. **LLM limitations** (R1_C4): Discussion section not visible but likely incomplete\n\n**CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED:**\n- Provide complete Methods section with all specifications requested\n- Add mathematical formulas with worked examples\n- Include code/data availability statements\n- Add LLM limitations discussion\n- Verify and unify all numerical results across entire manuscript\n- Remove internal revision tracking notes\n\nThe authors appear to have applied only \"Phase 1 (Numerical corrections)\" per their own note, but Phase 2 content additions—which address the majority of reviewer concerns—remain incomplete.",
