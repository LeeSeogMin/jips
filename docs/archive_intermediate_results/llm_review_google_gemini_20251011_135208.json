  "response": "Based on my expert review of the manuscript excerpt against the provided reviewer comments, I have identified several major outstanding issues. The \"AUTOMATED UPDATE APPLIED\" notice indicates that while numerical corrections may have been attempted, the more substantial content additions required to address the reviewer's concerns about methodology, metric definitions, and limitations have not yet been implemented.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the unaddressed comments and required fixes.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Review**\nThe authors have failed to address the majority of the reviewer's major comments. The provided excerpt (Abstract and Introduction) is insufficient to verify the resolution of any of the points, and the automated update note explicitly states that \"Phase 2 (Content additions) requires manual application,\" which directly corresponds to the major methodological and discussion-based concerns (Comments 2, 3, and 4). Comment 1, regarding numerical consistency, also cannot be fully verified without the results section and the requested supplementary materials.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Issues and Actionable Fixes**\n\n**ISSUE_ID:** R1_C1\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** Manuscript-wide (Abstract, Results, Conclusion) and Supplementary Material\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** N/A - The excerpt does not contain the specific numerical values (e.g., Cohen’s κ, correlation coefficients) mentioned by the reviewer, nor does it reference any supplementary tables or scripts.\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** The authors must perform a thorough audit of the entire manuscript to ensure every reported statistic is consistent across all sections (Abstract, main body, tables, figures, conclusion). Crucially, they must add a supplementary section or appendix containing the raw summary tables and/or commented scripts (e.g., a Jupyter notebook or R script) used to compute these values, as requested by the reviewer. An introductory sentence should be added to the Methods section, such as: \"All statistical analyses were performed using custom scripts, which are provided in the Supplementary Material along with the aggregated data used for calculations.\"\n**REASONING:** The reviewer explicitly requested verification and unification of numbers, and also asked for the raw data or scripts to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The automated update note's claim that \"Phase 1 (Numerical corrections) completed\" is unverifiable without this supporting material. Providing the underlying calculation methods is a standard requirement for rigorous quantitative research.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n**ISSUE_ID:** R1_C2\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** A new \"Methodology\" or \"Experimental Setup\" section (not present in the excerpt).\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** N/A - The required content is absent from the manuscript.\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** The authors must create a detailed subsection for each of the following, as requested by the reviewer:\n1.  **Embedding Models and Preprocessing:** Add a paragraph specifying the exact pre-trained model used (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`), including the specific checkpoint version from a model hub (e.g., Hugging Face). Detail all preprocessing steps (e.g., \"Text was lowercased, and stopwords from the NLTK English list were removed. No lemmatization was applied.\").\n2.  **LLM-based Evaluation:** Add a subsection titled \"LLM Evaluation Protocol\". This must include:\n    *   The model used (e.g., \"OpenAI's `gpt-4-0613`\").\n    *   The date of API access (e.g., \"All API calls were made between October 1st and October 5th, 2025.\").\n    *   All API parameters (e.g., `temperature=0.0` for deterministic output, `top_p=1.0`, `max_tokens=100`).\n    *   The aggregation method (e.g., \"Each topic-keyword pair was evaluated once. Continuous scores were...\").\n    *   Pseudo-code or a clear, step-by-step description of the logic for converting continuous LLM scores into categorical labels for the Cohen's κ calculation.\n3.  **Dataset Construction:** Add a subsection titled \"Synthetic Dataset Generation\". This must include:\n    *   The source and crawl/dump date (e.g., \"Wikipedia English dump from 2025-09-15\").\n    *   The exact seed queries or page titles used to generate each topic cluster.\n    *   The specific filtering rules applied (e.g., \"Documents with fewer than 100 words were excluded.\").\n    *   A link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo) containing the final datasets or the code to reproduce them.\n**REASONING:** This directly addresses the reviewer's critical point about insufficient methodological detail and reproducibility. Without this information, the results are unverifiable and the study cannot be replicated, which is a fundamental flaw. The automated update note confirms these content additions are still pending.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n**ISSUE_ID:** R1_C3\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** A new \"Proposed Evaluation Metrics\" subsection within the Methodology section.\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** N/A - The required content is absent from the manuscript.\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** The authors must create a subsection that formally defines their custom metrics. For each metric (e.g., Semantic Coherence, Semantic Distinctiveness, SemDiv), the authors must:\n1.  Provide the precise mathematical formula using standard notation.\n2.  Define every variable and parameter in the formula (e.g., \"where α represents... and was set to 0.5\").\n3.  Justify the choice of parameter values (e.g., \"α was set to 0.5 to give equal weight to...\").\n4.  Specify the value range of the metric (e.g., \"[0, 1], where 1 indicates perfect coherence\").\n5.  Include a small, clear worked example with toy data (e.g., 2 topics with 3 words each) to demonstrate the end-to-end calculation.\n**REASONING:** The reviewer correctly identified that the custom metrics, which are a central contribution of this paper, are undefined. Without formal definitions and examples, the metrics are ambiguous and cannot be understood, implemented, or trusted by readers.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH\n\n**ISSUE_ID:** R1_C4\n**CATEGORY:** MAJOR\n**LOCATION:** A new \"Limitations\" subsection within the Discussion or a dedicated Limitations section.\n**CURRENT_TEXT:** N/A - The required content is absent from the manuscript.\n**REQUIRED_FIX:** The authors must add a new subsection explicitly discussing the limitations of using LLMs for evaluation. This section should cover potential issues such as:\n*   **Bias:** Inherent biases in the LLM's training data that may affect its judgment of topic coherence.\n*   **Sensitivity:** The high sensitivity of LLM outputs to subtle changes in prompt wording.\n*   **Reproducibility:** The challenge of ensuring reproducible results, especially with non-deterministic API-based models.\n*   **Cost:** The financial and computational cost of performing large-scale evaluations using proprietary LLMs.\n*   **Opacity:** The \"black box\" nature of LLMs, which makes it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their evaluations.\nExample text: \"While using LLMs as proxy domain experts offers scalability, we acknowledge several limitations. First, the evaluation may reflect inherent biases present in the LLM's training data. Second, LLM judgments are highly sensitive to prompt design, and different phrasing could yield different results...\"\n**REASONING:** The reviewer's comment was cut off but clearly pointed towards discussing LLM evaluation limitations. This is a crucial component of academic integrity. Presenting LLMs as a perfect validation tool without acknowledging their well-known weaknesses is a significant oversight and misleads the reader about the robustness of the validation method.\n**CONFIDENCE:** HIGH",
