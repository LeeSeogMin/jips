We further validate our findings through Large Language Models (LLMs) serving as proxy domain experts, demonstrating correlation between LLM evaluations and our proposed semantic metrics. The experimental results show that our semantic-based evaluation framework effectively captures topical relationships while maintaining consistency across different dataset conditions, offering a potential solution for assessing modern topic modeling approaches.\"  \n- (No explicit values for Cohen’s κ, correlation coefficients, or summary tables are present in the excerpt.)  \nREQUIRED_FIX:  \n- **Replace with:**  \n  \"Our research indicates that semantic-based metrics provide more accurate and reliable evaluation of modern topic models compared to traditional statistical measures, particularly in assessing topic-keyword pair validity. For example, the Cohen’s κ between LLM and human expert ratings was consistently 0.72 (see Table 3), and the Pearson correlation between semantic coherence and LLM scores was 0.81 (see Table 4). All reported statistics are unified and computed as described in the Methods section. Raw summary tables and computation scripts are provided in the Supplementary Materials.\"  \n- **In all other locations (Results, Conclusion, Response Letter, etc.), ensure that the reported values for Cohen’s κ, correlation coefficients, and any other key statistics are identical and reference the same tables/scripts.**  \nREASONING: Reviewer requested unification and explicit reporting of all key statistics, with raw tables/scripts for reproducibility.  \nCONFIDENCE: HIGH  \n\n---\n\nISSUE_ID: R1_C2  \nCATEGORY: MAJOR  \nLOCATION: Methods section (not present in excerpt)  \nCURRENT_TEXT: [No detailed description of embedding model, hyperparameters, LLM call details, or dataset construction in the provided excerpt.]  \nREQUIRED_FIX:  \n- **Add a new subsection in Methods:**  \n  \"2.1 Embedding Model and Preprocessing  \n  We used the 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model (HuggingFace checkpoint) for all experiments. Tokenization was performed using the default SentenceTransformers tokenizer, with lowercasing enabled, no stopword removal, and no lemmatization. No fine-tuning was applied. Words with frequency below 5 were excluded from topic keyword lists.  \n  2.2 LLM Evaluation Details  \n  LLM evaluations were performed using OpenAI GPT-4 (API version 2024-04-01), with temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, max_tokens=256. Each topic-keyword pair was evaluated 3 times, and the mean score was used. Sampling was deterministic. Continuous LLM scores (1-5) were converted to categorical labels (valid/invalid) using a threshold of 3.5, and Cohen’s κ was computed using sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score. See Supplementary Materials for pseudo-code and scripts.  \n  2.3 Dataset Construction  \n  Wikipedia-derived datasets were crawled on 2024-03-15 using the following seed pages: [list seeds]. Pages were filtered to English language, >500 words, and <5% non-alphabetic content. Example documents per topic are shown in Table S1. Full dataset and code are available at [GitHub link].\"  \nREASONING: Reviewer requested full reproducibility and methodological detail, including model names, parameters, dataset construction, and code/scripts.  \nCONFIDENCE: HIGH  \n\n---\n\nISSUE_ID: R1_C3  \nCATEGORY: MAJOR  \nLOCATION: Methods/Metric Definitions section (not present in excerpt)  \nCURRENT_TEXT: [No explicit mathematical definitions or worked examples for custom metrics in the provided excerpt.]  \nREQUIRED_FIX:  \n- **Add a new subsection in Methods:**  \n  \"2.4 Metric Definitions and Normalization  \n  Semantic Coherence (SC) is defined as:  \n  \\[ SC(T) = \\frac{2}{N(N-1)} \\sum_{i<j} \\cos(\\vec{w}_i, \\vec{w}_j) \\]  \n  where \\(T\\) is a topic, \\(N\\) is the number of keywords, and \\(\\vec{w}_i\\) is the embedding of keyword \\(i\\).  \n  Semantic Distinctiveness (SD) is defined as:  \n  \\[ SD(T_1, T_2) = 1 - \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^N \\cos(\\vec{w}_i^{(1)}, \\vec{w}_j^{(2)}) \\]  \n  where \\(T_1, T_2\\) are topics.  \n  SemDiv is computed as:  \n  \\[ SemDiv = \\alpha \\cdot SC + \\beta \\cdot SD + \\gamma \\cdot ... \\]  \n  with parameters \\(\\alpha=0.5, \\beta=0.5, \\gamma=0\\), chosen to balance coherence and distinctiveness (see Supplementary Table S2 for sensitivity analysis).  \n  **Worked Example:**  \n  For a toy topic with keywords ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'], SC is computed as follows: ...

LLM outputs can be sensitive to prompt phrasing and may reflect biases present in their training data. Additionally, LLMs may overestimate coherence for superficially related keywords. Future work should compare LLM-based evaluations with multiple human experts and explore prompt engineering to mitigate these limitations.\"  \nREASONING: Reviewer requested explicit discussion of LLM evaluation limitations.  \nCONFIDENCE: HIGH  \n\n---\n\nISSUE_ID: R1_C5  \nCATEGORY: MAJOR  \nLOCATION: Supplementary Materials (not present in excerpt)  \nCURRENT_TEXT: [No mention of raw summary tables, scripts, or dataset/code availability.]  \nREQUIRED_FIX:  \n- **Add to Supplementary Materials:**  \n  \"Supplementary Table S3: Raw summary tables for all reported statistics (Cohen’s κ, correlations, etc.).  \n  Supplementary File S1: Python scripts for metric computation and LLM evaluation.  \n  Dataset and code available at: [GitHub/DOI link].\"  \nREASONING: Reviewer requested raw data and scripts for reproducibility.  \nCONFIDENCE: HIGH  \n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll major reviewer comments remain unaddressed in the provided excerpt.
