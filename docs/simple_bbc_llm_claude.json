      "**Explanation:**\n\nThis word group shows moderate-to-low coherence with significant inconsistencies:\n\n**Related clusters identified:**\n1. **Academic/institutional**: \"edu\", \"university\" - clearly related\n2. **Digital/technical**: \"com\", \"data\", \"system\", \"information\" - form a technology theme\n3. **Generic modifiers**: \"just\", \"good\", \"new\", \"time\" - vague and context-dependent\n\n**Issues affecting coherence:**\n\n1. **Weak thematic unity**: The words span multiple domains (education, technology, general descriptors) without a clear unifying concept\n\n2. **",
      "**Explanation:**\n\nThis word group shows moderate coherence with clear thematic clusters but some tension in overall unity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Strong geopolitical/ethnic cluster**: \"israel,\" \"israeli,\" \"armenian,\" \"turkish,\" \"jews,\" \"muslim\" all relate to Middle Eastern/Mediterranean ethnic groups, nationalities, and religions\n- **Institutional elements**: \"government\" and \"people\" provide sociopolitical context that could apply to any of these groups\n- **Religious dimension**: \"god,\" \"jews,\" and \"muslim\" connect through religious themes\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **\"Gun\" is the outlier",
      "**Explanation:**\n\nThis word group shows moderate coherence with a clear technical support theme, but includes some weaker connections.\n\n**Strong thematic elements:**\n- Core technical support vocabulary: \"help,\" \"problem,\" \"work\" form a clear troubleshooting context\n- Hardware/software terms: \"windows,\" \"drive,\" \"card\" relate to computer components\n- \"does,\" \"know\" are common auxiliary words in technical questions\n\n**Coherent pattern identified:**\nThese words strongly suggest a technical support forum post, likely something like: \"Thanks in advance, does anyone know how to help? My card/drive doesn't work with Windows - problem",
      "**Explanation:**\n\nThis word group shows low to moderate coherence for the following reasons:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Lack of clear theme**: The words don't converge around a specific topic or concept. They span multiple categories - cognitive verbs (think, know), desire verbs (want, need), social reference (people), temporal/spatial concepts (time, way), and discourse markers (like, just).\n\n2. **\"Don\" is problematic**: This word appears disconnected from the others. If it's meant as a verb (to put on) or a title, it doesn't relate to the other terms. It seems",
      "**Explanation:**\n\nThis word group demonstrates excellent coherence with a clear, unified theme centered on competitive sports, specifically team-based athletics.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Strong thematic unity**: All words directly relate to organized competitive sports\n2. **Semantic clustering**: Words naturally group into subcategories:\n   - Sport type: hockey, game/games\n   - Participants: team, players\n   - Actions: play, win\n   - Organizational structure: league, season, year\n3. **Contextual consistency**: These words frequently co-occur in sports discourse\n4. **No outliers**: Every word belongs to"

    "distinctiveness": "## Explanation:\n\n**Strong Distinctions (Topics with clear separation):**\n\n- **Topic 2** (geopolitical/religious): Highly distinct with specific focus on Middle Eastern politics, religion, and ethnic groups (Israel, Armenian, Turkish, Jews, Muslim). No overlap with other topics.\n\n- **Topic 3** (technical support): Clear technical computing focus (Windows, drive, card, problem, help). Distinctive vocabulary related to troubleshooting.\n\n- **Topic 5** (sports): Unambiguous sports theme with hockey-specific terminology (game, team, season, hockey, league). Completely separate semantic space.",
    "diversity": "## Explanation:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Clear Thematic Separation (0.85)**: The topics cover distinctly different domains:\n   - Topic 1: Academic/technical/information systems\n   - Topic 2: Politics/religion/international affairs\n   - Topic 3: Technical support/computing hardware\n   - Topic 4: General discussion/opinion\n   - Topic 5: Sports (specifically hockey)\n\n2. **Semantic Range (0.75)**: Good variation from concrete (hardware, sports) to abstract (opinions, beliefs) concepts, and from technical to social domains.\n\n**Weaknesses:**",
